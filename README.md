## Motivation
The Pileup Mappability metric can be used to quickly identify regions which may be more difficult to perform variant calling with short-read WGS data. `pupmapper` was created to allow users to quickly convert k-mer mappability scores to pileup mappability. 

The first step of the `pupmapper` pipeline is to calculate k-mer uniquness scores using the [Genmap](https://github.com/cpockrandt/genmap) software. Then pupmapper will summarize the pileup mappability of each genomic position using the k-mer uniqueness of all overlapping k-mers.


### How is pileup mappability calculated from individual k-mer uniqueness/mappability scores?

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/maxgmarin/pupmapper/raw/main/Images/Derrien2012.PmapFig.png" alt="PmapFig">
The Pileup mappability of a position is specifically calculated as the mean k-mer mappability of all k-mers overlapping a given position. <br>

A pileup mappability score of 1 indicates that all k-mers overlapping with a position are unique within the genome (using the user defined parameters of uniqueness).

**Pileup mappability is useful because it gives a sense of uniquemess of all possible reads (of defined length) that could align to a given position.**

## Installation

You will need to install both the `pupmapper` python package and ensure that the [genmap](https://github.com/cpockrandt/genmap) software is installed (available on your $PATH environmental variable.)

### Install locally
`pupmapper` can be installed by cloning this repository and installing with `pip`.

```
git clone git@github.com:maxgmarin/pupmapper.git

cd pupmapper

pip install . 
```

### `pip`
```
pip install pupmapper
```

### `conda`

## Basic usage


#### 1) `run_all` - Run the full pipeline starting with an input genome

```
pupmapper run_all -i Input.Genome.fasta -o output_directory/ -k 50 -e 1
```
The above command will first use genmap to calculate k-mer mappability scores for the input genome and then calculate pileup mappability scores.

Arguments:

`-i, --in_genome_fa`: Input genome FASTA file. <br>
`-o, --outdir`: Directory for output files. <br>
`-k, --kmer_len`: K-mer length (e.g., 50 bp). <br>
`-e, --errors`: Number of allowed mismatches in k-mer mapping. <br>
`-g, --gff`: (Optional) Input genome annotations in GFF format. <br>
`--save-numpy`: (Optional) Save results as compressed numpy arrays. <br>


### Analyzing included test sequence

If you wish to run an `pupmapper` on a small test sequence (15 bp), you can run the following commands:
```
cd tests/data/Genmap_Ex1/

pupmapper run_all -i Ex1.genome.fasta -o Ex1_OutputDir -k 4 -e 0
```
This command will analyze the pileup mappability of the test sequence with a k-mer size of 4 bp and a max mismatch of 0 (K=4,E=0).


## Full usage
```
pupmapper run_all --help
usage: pupmapper run_all [-h] -i IN_GENOME_FA -o OUTDIR -k KMER_LEN -e ERRORS [-g GFF] [--save-numpy]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IN_GENOME_FA, --in_genome_fa IN_GENOME_FA
                        Input genome fasta file (.fasta)
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                        Directory for all outputs of k-mer and pileup mappability processing.
  -k KMER_LEN, --kmer_len KMER_LEN
                        k-mer length (bp) used to generate the k-mer mappability values
  -e ERRORS, --errors ERRORS
                        Number of errors (mismatches) allowed in Genmap's k-mer mappability calculation
  -g GFF, --gff GFF     GFF formatted genome annotations for input genome (.gff) (Optional)
  --save-numpy          If enabled, all pileup mappability scores will be output as compressed numpy arrays (.npz).
